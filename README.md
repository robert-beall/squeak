# squeak
This is a deep-dive into relational databases and SQL.

This project will be split into two parts: *Notes* and *Lab*. 

## Notes
The notes section will contain cheatsheets and documentation serving as a knowledge repository for future review.

## Lab
The lab will be a simple containerized test relational database that I will use to imrpove my database design and SQL knowledge.
